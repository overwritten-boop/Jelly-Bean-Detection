This project uses a retrained version of imagenet to detect jelly bean flavors in a bowl from an abovehead camera.
The end goal would be to automatically remove and seperate the jelly beans, however for this timescheme i plan to simply have the program print an alert message to the console whenever a unwanted jelly bean flavor is detected.
This could effect all the people who dislike ceratin jelly bean flavors.
